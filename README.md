<h1>About me</h1>

- 👋 Hi, I’m <b>Luthfi</b>, you can call me anything you prefer
- 👀 Still in university, but willing to work, maybe
- 🌱 I can do web dev, currently learning JS and Py, frequently using Django as Backend and Tailwind as Style Framework
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on anything, im serious
- 📫 You can reach me at.. idk, just DM me if you need something.

<br>

<b>Why do i use Tailwind?</b> Of course i can write the vanilla code, but if you see the name Tail Wind, how cool is it? The wind have a tail to give the web some styling
<br>
just joking, i chose it because its easy to use and flexible

<br>

My best project? Sure, <a href="https://arpay.vercel.app">Arpay</a>, this project is still live and on-going

<br>

If you want to know me more, try to look my <a href="https://mulfis.github.io">Web Profile</a> (its not done yet)
